# Timer Countdown Indicator

This is a custom indicator called 'Timer Countdown' developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to enhance trading by providing a countdown timer for the closure of each bar. The indicator can be used in MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading platform.

## How it works

The Timer Countdown indicator calculates the remaining time until the closure of the current bar. It displays the countdown timer prominently on the user interface and also implements a progress bar to visually represent the progress of the countdown.

The indicator utilizes the following global variables:
- `barClosureTime`: Holds the closure time of the current bar.
- `countdownMinutes`: Stores the remaining minutes until bar closure.
- `countdownSeconds`: Stores the remaining seconds until bar closure.

During the initialization of the indicator (`OnInit()` function), the `barClosureTime` is set to the current bar's closure time. Then, the remaining time until the bar closure is calculated by subtracting the current time from `barClosureTime`. The minutes and seconds are stored in `countdownMinutes` and `countdownSeconds` variables respectively.

In the `OnCalculate()` function, the remaining time is recalculated to update the countdown. The countdown timer and progress bar are displayed on the user interface using the `Comment()` and `ProgressBarSet()` functions respectively.

When the countdown timer reaches zero (i.e., `countdownMinutes` and `countdownSeconds` both equal to zero), the indicator triggers a 'Bar Closure Alert' using the `Alert()` function.
